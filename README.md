## Casper VS Nightwatch VS Protrator
 They all support for different unit test frameworks like (Jasmine, Mocha, Cucumber etc..)
 They all support good reporting mechanism (html, xml etc..)

 - Casper: 6.6k ï¼š 
 It is written in Python, i.e. it is not a native Node.js solution.
    - It uses  headless browser engines (PhantomJS or SlimerJS).
    - Tests run much faster compared to real browsers.
 
 - Nightwatch: 6.6k

    - It is a custom implementation of W3C webdriver API, like WebDriverIO.
    - Its benefits include highly transparent and readable test code.
    - It needs to use waits in code while Protractor and TestCafe have built-in waiting mechanism.
 
 - Protrator: 6.5k
  It is the only automation tool which has inbuilt support for AngularJS element 

     - It does not have support to automate mobile Apps.
